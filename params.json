Angela Sasse](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/m_angela_sasse/) and Dr. [Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/). We belong to the Information Security Research Group and UCL Academic Center of Excellence for Cyber Security Research. Broadly, I research user-centered and secure messaging. I aim to understand how users perceive secure messaging, and compare that with the actual underlying security of different messaging tools.\r\n\r\nMy research is funded by a Google Research Award, supporting \"open-source secure messaging development research\".\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n### Talks\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
