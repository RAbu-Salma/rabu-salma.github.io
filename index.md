Ruba Abu-Salma is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), supervised by [Angela Sasse](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/m_angela_sasse/) and co-supervised by [Steven Murdoch](https://murdoch.is). Ruba’s research is multidisciplinary; it spans computer security, computer privacy, and human-computer interaction (HCI). Ruba takes a user-centered approach to the design and use of privacy-enhancing technologies. She seeks to understand users’ needs, practices, and perceptions with regards to privacy tools, and what influences users’ decision to adopt, or not adopt, a particular tool.

Ruba has received a Supporting Usability and Design in Security (SUDS) Research Fellowship from the Open Technology Fund and Simply Secure, as well as a Marie-Skłodowska Curie Fellowship. Ruba’s research has also been supported by Google. Her work has been covered by the popular press, such as The Register and CNET.
