Ruba Abu-Salma is a Lecturer (~Asst. Professor) in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) in the Dept. of Informatics at King’s College London (KCL). Ruba’s research is multidisciplinary; it spans computer security, privacy, human-computer interaction (HCI), and cybercrime. Before joining KCL, Ruba was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Usable Security and Privacy Group at ICSI/UC Berkeley in 2021 and in the PRIVATICS Team at Inria Sophia Antipolis in 2020. She also spent the summer of 2020 at the University of Cambridge, working on how cybercrime has changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ruba obtained her PhD in Computer Science from University College London (UCL) in 2019. As a graduate student, she received a Supporting Usability and Design in Security (SUDS) Fellowship from the Open Technology Fund, as well as a Marie-Skłodowska Curie Research Fellowship. Her research was also supported by Google. Her work has been published in top-tier security and privacy venues (including Oakland, CHI, and SOUPS) and has been covered by the popular press, such as the New York Times, The Register, and CNET.
