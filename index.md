I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London (UCL)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. M. Angela Sasse](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/m_angela_sasse/) and [Dr. Sarah Meiklejohn](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Meiklejohn/). We are members of the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/). Broadly, my research focuses on taking a user-centered approach to the design of secure communications. I am supported by a [SUDS Fellowship](https://www.opentech.fund/fellowships/suds) from the [Open Technology Fund (OTF)](https://www.opentech.fund/) and [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/). My research is also funded by Google.

I obtained an M.Sc. (with Distinction) in Information Security from UCL in 2014. Before joining UCL, I earned a B.Sc. (1st Hons) in Computer Engineering from the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu/) in 2013.
